                <h1>James Daly</h1>
                <h2>Front End Web Developer</h2>
                <p>I like to call myself a born again computer nerd.  Since 2009, I’ve been creating, coding and even designing websites. Whether it’s learning a new language, discovering a new technology or just studying a new javascript framework/library;  I love to learn all things regarding web development.  Technology changes rapidly and it’s important to keep up with the latest trends but also to understand the needs of a project and not try to overcomplicate processes.  I have spent most of my career working with front end technologies, CSS, SCSS, LESS, Javascript, Jquery, Backbone, Angular to name a few and HMTL 5 API’s - canvas, SVG, and WebSockets.  However, I have also learned and have experience with the following programming languages/applications which include Node.js,  PHP/Wordpress, C#,  MySql and NoSql, Git and Photoshop  Below is a sample of work accomplishments and personal projects.</p>
