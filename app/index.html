                <h1>James Daly</h1>
                <h2>Full Stack Engineer</h2>
                <p>
                    I like to call myself a born again computer nerd. Since
                    2009, I’ve been building, creating, and even designing web
                    applications. Whether it’s learning a new language,
                    discovering a new technology or just studying a new
                    framework/library; I love to learn all things regarding web
                    development. I specialize in building full stack dynamic web
                    applications using React on the front end and Node on the
                    back end while incorporating with Sql and NoSql databases
                    and also creating CI/CD piplines for seamless development.
                    The last four years, I have worked extensively with
                    decentralized applications (dApps). I have experiece
                    integrating wallets/smart contracts within web apps and
                    additionally creating and deploying smart contracts written
                    in Solidity. I hope to continue my journey and passion with
                    blockchain technologies.

                            As a UI engineer for Marvel Entertainment I was able
                            to work on a variety of fun projects. We converted
                            our flash comic book reader to a HTML 5 single page
                            applcation Using SVG.js, Backbone.js and Sass/Scss
                            during the same time we created an in house tool
                            using AngularJS for publishers/adminstrators to
                            create/author infinite comics; additionally I
                            created a jQuery plugin for a hangman type character
                            guessing game for our Characters section and was
                            part of the responsive redesign of the company's
                            main site.

                            Treasure Wallet Hunt is an application I conceived,
                            created and built on my own. The application is a
                            game and learning center for those new to crypto and
                            also crypto enthusiasts. It's a guessing game that
                            rewards users with crypto currencies. The goal of
                            the game is to guess consecutive words of a seed
                            phrase by providing hints. The application
                            integrates token economics, wallet and email
                            integration for those who have never created a
                            self-custody wallet.

                            been a fan of playing gin rummy with family and

                            computer). Using front end technologies I was able
                            to create a game using HTML 5 localStore for
                            scoring, CSS3 for card animations Ecmascript 5

                            A project I created on my own out of my love of
                            playing darts. I was trying to find an online dart
                            scoring application on the web and I couldn't find
                            one; so I created my own. It's a socring application
                            for _01 games. Using a table based layout to create
                            content editable fields that users can enter scores
                            and it will subtract them until the user gets zero

                            to create their site I was honored. This responsive

                            created a custom Wordpress template and integrated
                            various third party API's including google maps, and
                            twitter. I was also able to implement front end

                            and masonry.js for a cusom image grid layout.
